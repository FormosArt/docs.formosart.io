# Listing tokens from your collection

Currently, there are two ways for you to list the art you have collected for sale. The first is by setting a minimum bid which is explained in this [article](/guide/setting-a-minimum-bid). This is a way of opening your artwork up to offers from other collectors. If you want to set a buy now price however, the way this can be done is through accessing the three dot button (...) on the works in your collection. From this menu you will need to select 'sell this item' which will launch the window shown below.

Here you will simply need to enter the price you want to list the token for and confirm which will launch a transaction to complete the listing process.

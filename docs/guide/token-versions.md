# What do the different Token versions mean?

As the site has evolved and new functionality has been added over time and because of the nature of smart contracts with every new iteration of the site we have also had to create new versions of tokens. Please note that while newer version of tokens fundamentally represent the same thing as older tokens they do give you access to some newer functions the site has begun to offer. This includes some sales mechanics that are coming with FA V3 as can be seen in the table below:

| Token Version | Buy Now | Bids | Reserve Auction  | Stepped Sale |
|---------------|---------|------|------------------|--------------|
| V1            |    ✅    |   ✅  |         ❌        |       ❌      |
| V2            |    ✅    |   ✅  |         ❌        |       ❌      |
| V3            |    ✅    |   ✅  |         ✅        |       ✅      |

To see which version a token is you are looking at you can go to the tokens page and in the bottom right there is will be a selection of tabs. If you select the 'Info' tab it will display in the data which version the token is you are looking at.

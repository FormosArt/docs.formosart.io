# What is the difference between an Edition and a Token?

An edition represents a limited set of tokens which all share the same attributes but each token is unique through its token IDs.
For example, if I create an edition of 25, each token issued from this edition will share all the same attributes (apart from their token ID) APART FROM PROGRAMMABLE TOKENS
as defined when the edition was originally *minted*. Tokens will be sequentially assigned a unique token ID
based on the order they are issued.

FormosArt enforces the number of tokens which can be issued from an edition on-chain and can be verified.

## What defines an edition

An edition is made up of two sets of data, consisting of data stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) which is then referenced on chain,
plus some additional on-chain attributes which enforce things like creator and edition size amongst other things.

In general these two pieces of data define the blue print for what an edition is and what it's associated metadata are.

### What data is stored on-chain

When a V3 edition is minted the following items are defined and recorded on-chain:

```solidity
   struct EditionDetails {
    address creator; // primary edition/token creator
    uint16 editionSize; // onchain edition size
    string uri; // the referenced metadata
}
```

Below is what is stored on a V2 edition, notice it is much longer, this is because we are able to extrapolate all the necessary data from the information above. We did this to make performing actions with the tokens much more gas efficient and consequently cheaper!

```solidity
  struct EditionDetails {
    // Identifiers
    uint256 editionNumber;    // The edition ID, all tokens issued from a single edition will share the same edition ID
    bytes32 editionData;      // Optional data field
    uint256 editionType;      // An extra type identifier
    // Config
    uint256 startDate;        // The date an edition is available
    uint256 endDate;          // Ths date an edition cannot be issued from
    address artistAccount;    // The artist who created this edition
    uint256 artistCommission; // Artists commission percentage
    uint256 priceInWei;       // Initial base price
    string tokenURI;          // IPFS data link
    bool active;              // Is the edition alive or dead
    // Counters
    uint256 totalSupply;      // Total tokens issued
    uint256 totalAvailable;   // Total available within an edition
  }
```

Some of these properties can change such as `totalSupply` being incremented by one each time a token has been issued.
Along with the `priceInWei` which can be modified by the `artistAccount` associated to it.

There are also some other properties which are stored on-chain when an edition is being created, such as any collaborators
details which are then used to split any fees accordingly.

FormosArt ($FADA) tokens are fully [ERC721](http://erc721.org/) compliant.

### Why did we create Editions like this?

Our first iteration of FormosArt created all the tokens upfront, after doing this for a few months we realised it was prohibitively
expensive to do so (for us and for creators), we also originally had ideas that editions could be in the hundreds or even thousands of tokens,
like traditional print media.

So we move to minting on demand letting the artists create a blue print, significantly reducing [GAS](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-gas/) costs. It also
enables some other advantages beyond just GAS costs savings, since an edition is a single entity you can easily control
aspects such as price in a single, cost effective transaction, as well as easily burning unsold tokens without burning
all tokens individually.

It's not all roses though, this comes with some trade-offs - primarily being that all the tokens don't appear immediately in a creator's wallet or account.
If needed, as a creator you can however gift tokens to yourself which then causes them to appear on sites such as OpenSea and CryptoVoxels.

With the latest version of FA (V3) we have managed to resolve this issue whilst maintaining gas efficiency.

### What data do we store on IPFS?

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) _(unfortunately)_ stands for InterPlanetary File System, although not a great name in our opinion.
The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

The IPFS network enabled files to be uploaded and stored by a network of willing participants, in a network of peer-to-peer nodes.
It also has other additional, important, features such as content addressable data, also known as IPFS hashes or CIDs (Content Identifiers).
This means that the data uploaded produces a unique fingerprint based on the data itself, enabling you to prove the data stored on IPFS marries
up to the reference kept on-chain, along with ensuring it cannot be changed for something else as the hash would also change.

A sample `JSON` blob we store on IPFS can be seen below:

```json
{
  "name": "Test 360",
  "description": "Test 360",
  "attributes": {
    "artist": "FormosArt",
    "scarcity": "rare",
    "format": "Craft",
    "theme": "Cubism",
    "tags": [
      "2020",
      "360 image sphere"
    ],
    "asset_type": "image/jpeg",
    "asset_size_in_bytes": 8290426,
    "production_year": "2021"
  },
  "artist": "0x3f8c962eb167ad2f80c72b5f933511ccdf0719d4",
  "external_uri": "https://FormosArt.io/0x3f8c962eb167ad2f80c72b5f933511ccdf0719d4",
  "image": "ipfs://QmQLWzxLgmhCUMJ3oa3qE2btvbVPTPUZNEKKwPRvPsocsG/asset.jpg",
  "image_sphere": true
}
```

_Note: - not all tokens have the same metadata, as the project has evolved some attributes have been dropped and some have been added._

IPFS, although used widely due to some of the properties mentioned above, it also has some downsides.
The main problem is how it relies on trusted or incentivised parties, such as FormosArt, to always maintain a copy of that data.
However, the good thing is that anyone, really anyone can also maintain this same data, anyone can participate in its
upkeep by simply deciding to also store the files.

We have been looking at alternatives such as Arweave and FileCoin, along with others.
In the future we may consider leveraging additional storage options if required to do so.

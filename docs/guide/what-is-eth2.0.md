# What is ETH 2.0?

ETH 2.0 is a replacement network with will eventually upgrade the current Ethereum network. 

It's been in the works for 4-5 years and will hopefully be the final global shared compute platform which
 runs lots of very exciting stuff, including FA eventually. 

[consensys](https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/ethereum-2/faq) <- some docs

[block explorer](http://beaconcha.in/) <- ETH 2.0 block explorer 

[Staking options](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices) <- ETH 2.0 stacking options 

The network is super busy as people are setting up ETH 2.0 validating nodes and depositing collateral to be staked.
 Running these nodes is not exactly easy so please research lots about it if you are intending to do this. 
 **Its also risky, so be careful.** 

## How will it impact FA?

Good question - the reality is that FA will not be impacted for many, many months, or at all,
 as ETH 2.0 which is currently launching, does not allow anything other than deposits into a staking contract.
  
This is also known as "Phase 0", and will become the bedrock for all future iterations of the ETH 2.0 network. 

In the future there are plans to merge in ETH 1.0 into a shard of the ETH 2.0 network, 
this "should" be a seamless transition and "should" not impact FA directly. 
We also don't expect this for 12-18 months at the earliest so no need to do anything now. 

## Do I need to do anything now?

No, if you want to participate in the new network I would recommend reading lots articles or joining a staking pool.
 FA will function fine without any changes during this transition and once/if any changes are needed, 
 we will notify everyone about them. 

---------------------

My opinion is that if ETH 2.0 works as is, it will solidify Ethereum as the top global smart contract platform
 that will enable trustless compute for generations to come, but in reality that is still a dream and is
  a few years away.

Hope this helps answer any questions - DM to team if you have anymore.

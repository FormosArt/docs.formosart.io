# How to transfer token

You are able to transfer any token you have either collected or are yet to sell through the transfer function. This is accessible from the three dots <strong>(...)</strong> button. This can be found in the bottom right of any artworks that you have minted within the artworks tab on your profile or that you own in your collection tab.
